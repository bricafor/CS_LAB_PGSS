 Today's Focus: 
 Synthetic Data Generation 
    Extrapolation necessary for a lack of samples (synthetic oversampling). 
    Use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to view patterns within limited samples.
    Extrapolation allows the researcher to finds patters and correlation between data.
  
 Created a program that analyzed the class's perception of the color purple -- crowdsourcing. 
    Gender correlated with a student's perception of purple, which affects the RGB of the chosen color.
    Created a variety of models that evaluated the dataset. (Each model had its own accuracy.)
