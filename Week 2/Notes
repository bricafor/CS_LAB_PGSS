Use transformers in order to convert blocks of text into points on a coordinate system. 
  Each block of text has its own point on the coordinate system (x, y, and z), and the distance formula is used to convey the similarities 
  between each piece of text. (The greater the calculated distance, the greater the differences between each piece of text.) 
     Distance is a vector. 
Cleanse: 
  1. Remove special lines, punctuation, HTML tags, etc. from text. 
  2. Correct case (lowercase). 
  3. Finish cleaning text. 
After cleansing the text, split the text into "train" and "test" -- train a model, 2 characteristics. 
  Save model, then load model for prediction. 
  Prediction is ultimately used to see whether or not movies on the IMDB site had a negative or postiive review using specific keywords
  correlated with a each type of review. 
Text: standard length, numeric representation -- transformed. 
Used boxplots and the normal distribution in order to better understand probability in a dataset.
  1.5 * IQR Rule -- useful for finding the probability of finding specific pieces of data in a dataset.
  (For example, 1.5 * IQR rule can be used to find the probability of whether or not there will be a data point that is 2 standard 
  deviations away from the mean.)
