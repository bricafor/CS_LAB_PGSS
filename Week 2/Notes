  Use transformers in order to convert blocks of text into points on a coordinate system. 
    Each block of text has its own point on the coordinate system (x, y, and z), and the distance formula is used to convey the similarities 
    between each piece of text. (The greater the calculated distance, the greater the differences between each piece of text.) 
      Distance is a vector.
