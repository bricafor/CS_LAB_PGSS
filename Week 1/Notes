For Google Colaboratory: 
    Used Google Colaboratory in order to analyze data in the form of traditional tables, as well as histograms and box plots.
    Help > Search Code Snippets
    Code Snippets: Can read or import files. 
    Sections: Helpful for organizing data, hiding certain lines of code. 
    + Code vs. + Text 
    Test: Can use special characters (eg. *) in order to add effects to the code.
Github: Knit option -- requires packages. Used to convert code into PDFs.
**Important Reminder: Watch for careless syntax errors and inconsistent variable names.**

British Seatbelt Study -- Practice with various types of graphs; data analysis. 
Looked through various models (eg. boxplots, scatterplots) in order to determine the best way to analyze the data.  
Used columns / categories to form predictions, new sets of data. 
    FractionofDriversKilled = DriversKilled / Drivers 
Linear Regression vs. Logistic Regression
    Linear Regression: Continuous response
    Logistic Regression: Categorical response
    *Which method is the best to analyze specific categories of data?* 
Reminders: 
- Review downloading file content. 
- Review MatPlotLib commands -- extremely helpful for generating graphs, analyzing data in various forms. 
- Understand graphing capabilities of Python, R -- basic review, future concepts.
